# Attributions

We are standing on the shoulders of giants.

The following third-party, opensource software are core components of the cluster.
Without these great projects this would not have been possible.

- ffmpeg &mdash; [:octicons-globe-16: ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org)
- srs &mdash; [:octicons-mark-github-16: ossrs/srs](https://github.com/ossrs/srs)
- django &mdash; [:octicons-globe-16: djangoproject.com](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- supervisor &mdash; [:octicons-globe-16: supervisord.org](https://supervisord.org)

All of these projects are opensource, so we hold ourselves to the standard of
contributing everything we can back to the world, as free opensource.
